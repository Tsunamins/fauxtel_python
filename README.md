# Fauxtel Python

An alternative backend to my personal project Fauxtel Hotels, in Python/FastAPI.

A work in progress, eventually meant to be synced with my FauxtelHotels frontend and have a more user frienly instructions for running locally.

To run, I recommend creating a local docker container in postgres or setup postgres locally. Eventually I'll do a Docker file.

From here fastapi dev main.py should do the trick.

# Fauxtel Python

In the final phase of my bootcamp, the final project was a separate Ruby Rails API with a front end react app that made calls to that API. Since then I've experienced a range of backend experiences on the job, I decided I needed to add some working demonstrations of my foundational knowledge in other areas, especially those more popular such as Python. 

So this is at least the beginning of a Python api demonstration to match my final bootcamp project.

Eventually I will sync it up with the front end as well, but for now it's a work in progress.

To run, I recommend creating a local docker container in postgres or setup postgres locally. Eventually I'll do a Docker file.

From here fastapi dev main.py should do the trick.
